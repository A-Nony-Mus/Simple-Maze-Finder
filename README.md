# Simple-Maze-Finder

This is an exercise testing the A* path finding algorithm. It is a simple application that is implemented in under 150 lines of code.

## Getting Started

This program expects a maze.txt file to be in the same folder. This file will contain an 8x8 matrix of os and xs (both letters). Each o denotes an empty space that the program can traverse and each x denotes an obstacle.

### Prerequisites

All that is needed to run this is the GNU C Compiler (gcc)
